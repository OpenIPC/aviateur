### Common run issues

If the application crashes at startup, try installing [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version).

### How to build
1. Install vcpkg.
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg; .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies.
   ```powershell
   .\vcpkg integrate install
   .\vcpkg install libusb ffmpeg libsodium opencv
   ```

3. Add VCPKG_ROOT() to environment. (Change the value to your vcpkg path.)

4. Clone third-party library source.
   ```powershell
   cd aviateur
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

5. Open as a CMake project and build.

### Common build issues

```
CMake Error at C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/Common7/IDE/CommonExtensions/Microsoft/CMake/CMake/share/cmake-3.29/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230 (message): ...
```

This is because the pre-installed vcpkg from Visual Studio installer overrides the PKG_ROOT environment variable.
To fix this, find `set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "$ENV{VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake")` in CMakeLists.txt, replace `$ENV{VCPKG_ROOT}` with the vcpkg you cloned previously.
