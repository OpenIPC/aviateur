# Wi-Fi Broadcast FPV client for Windows platform.

Forked from [fpv4win](https://github.com/OpenIPC/fpv4win]), aviateur is an app for Windows that packages multiple components together to decode an H264/H265 video feed broadcast by wfb-ng over the air.

- [devourer](https://github.com/openipc/devourer): A userspace rtl8812au driver initially created by [buldo](https://github.com/buldo) and converted to C by [josephnef](https://github.com/josephnef) .
- [wfb-ng](https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng): A library that allows broadcasting the video feed over the air.

Supports RTL8812AU Wi-Fi adapter only.

It is recommended to use with [OpenIPC](https://github.com/OpenIPC).
